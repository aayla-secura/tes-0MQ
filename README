Layout of the trunk is:
- include:   header files
- src/bin:   source files for the main server and client
- src/lib:   source files for the libraries used by the main server
- test-apps: source files for miscellaneous test programs

To compile and install the client (tesc) and server (tesd) do:

 make
 make install
 make clean

The default install prefix is /usr/local, to change it do:

 make PREFIX=<path> install

Note: it is a GNU makefile, so on some systems (e.g. FreeBSD) you need to use
gmake.

Both client and server will print usage when given the '-h' option.

To compile the test apps do 'make test' or alternatively 'make all' to compile
everything. Test apps are not installed in system location.

See comments at the beginning of src/lib/tesd_tasks.c for the API used in the
client progarm.

Only tested on Linux 4.8.4 and above, and FreeBSD 11.0
