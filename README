Layout of the trunk is:
- include:      header files
- src/bin:      source binary files
- src/bin/test: miscellaneous test files
- src/lib:      source library files
- lib:          compiled libraries (created by make install if missing)
- bin:          compiled binaries  (created by make install if missing)

There is a Makefile in both src/bin and src/lib which is used respectively to
build and install binaries or libraries. From the trunk do:

 cd src/lib
 make all
 make install
 cs ../bin
 make all
 make install

The Makefile in src/bin also works for src/bin/test, just do (in src/bin)
 
 make test/name_of_executable_without_extension

The Makefile will link with the necessary libraries (and it will make sure
include and lib in the trunk are given to gcc). Before running a program in
bin/ do

 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/trunk/lib

Note, at the moment there's only one library, daemon and it's only used if
src/bin/server.c is compiled with BE_DAEMON.

To modify CFLAGS and other global parameters passed to gcc (or the compiler
executable itself), see Makefile in the trunk directory, which is sourced by
the other Makefiles.

bin/server is the server program, bin/client is the client which includes
a help (usage) message when run with no args.

See comments at the beginning of src/bin/server.c.

Only tested on Linux 4.8.4 at the moment.
