/*
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------
 * --------------------------- DEV NOTES ---------------------------
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------
 * There is a separate thread for each "task". Threads are zactors.
 * Currently there are two tasks:
 * 1) Listen on a REP socket and save all frames to file (until
 *    a requested number of ticks pass).
 * 2) Collate MCA frames for publishing via a PUB socket.
 *
 * Tasks have read-only access to rings (they cannot modify the
 * cursor or head) and each task keeps its own head (for each ring),
 * which is visible by the coordinator (tesd.c). For each ring, the
 * coordinator sets the true head to the per-task head which lags
 * behind all others.
 *
 * Tasks are largely similar, so we pass the same handler,
 * s_task_shim, to zactor_new. It is responsible for doing most of
 * the work. Tasks are described by a struct _task_t (see
 * tesd_tasks.h).
 *
 * s_task_shim registers a generic reader, s_sig_hn, for handling
 * the signals from the coordinator. Upon SIG_STOP s_sig_hn exits,
 * upon SIG_WAKEUP it calls calls the task's specific packet handler
 * for each packet in each ring. It keeps track of the previous
 * frame and protocol sequences (the task's packet handler can make
 * use of those as well, e.g. to track lost frames). For convenience
 * the number of missed frames (difference between previous and
 * current frame sequences mod 2^16) is passed to the pkt_handler.
 * s_sig_hn also takes care of updating the task's head.
 *
 * If the task defines a public interface address, s_task_shim will
 * open the socket, and if it defines a client handler, it will
 * register it with the task's loop. Each task has a pointer for its
 * own data.
 *
 * Before entering the loop, s_task_shim will call the task
 * initializer, if it is set. So it can allocate the pointer to its
 * data and do anything else it wishes (talk to clients, etc).
 *
 * Tasks defined with the autoactivate flag on are activated before
 * entering the loop. Otherwise the task should activate itself from
 * within its initializer or in its client frontend handler.
 *
 * Tasks defined with the automute flag must have a client_handler.
 * The handler will then be deregistered from the loop upon task
 * activation, and registered again upon deactivation.
 *
 * Right after the loop terminates, s_task_shim will call the task
 * finalizer, so it can cleanup its data and possibly send final
 * messages to clients.
 *
 * The actual task is done inside client_handler and pkt_handler.
 *
 *   client_handler processes messages on the public socket. If
 *   front_addr is not set, the task has no public interface.
 *
 *   pkt_handler is called by the generic socket reader for each
 *   packet in each ring and does whatever.
 *
 * Both handlers have access to the zloop so they can enable or
 * disable readers (e.g. the client_handler can disable itself after
 * receiving a job and the pkt_handler can re-enable it when done).
 *
 * If either handler encounters a fatal error, it returns with
 * TASK_ERROR.
 *
 * If the task wants to deactivate itself, it should call
 * s_task_deactivate. Alternatively it can return with TASK_SLEEP
 * from within the pkt_handler. The task then won't be receiving
 * SIG_WAKEUP and its heads won't be synchronized with the real
 * heads.
 *
 * After talking to a client, if it needs to process packets again,
 * the task must reactivate via s_task_activate. Note that tasks
 * which do not talk to clients have no way of reactivating
 * themselves, so their pkt_handler should never return with
 * TASK_SLEEP.
 *
 * The error, busy and active flags are handled by s_sig_hn and
 * s_task_shim. Tasks' handlers should only make use of
 * s_task_activate, s_task_deactivate and return codes (0,
 * TASK_SLEEP or TASK_ERROR).
 *
 * Tasks are defined in a static global array, see THE TASK LIST.
 *
 * Note on zactor:
 * We start the task threads using zactor high-level class, which on
 * UNIX systems is a wrapper around pthread_create. zactor_new
 * creates two PAIR zmq sockets and creates a detached thread
 * caliing a wrapper (s_thread_shim) around the hanlder of our
 * choice. It starts the actual handler (which we pass to
 * zactor_new), passing it its end of the pipe (a PAIR socket) as
 * well as a void* argument of our choice (again, given to
 * zactor_new). The handler must signal down the pipe using
 * zsock_signal (doesn't matter the byte status), since zactor_new
 * will be waiting for this before it returns. The handler must
 * listen on the pipe for a terminating signal, which is sent by the
 * actor's destructor (called by zactor_destroy). Upon receiving
 * this signal the handler must return. It returns into
 * s_thread_shim which signals down the pipe before destroying that
 * end of the pipe. The destructor must wait for this signal before
 * returning into zactor_destroy, which destroys the other end of
 * the pipe and returns to the caller. Hence zactor_destroy acts
 * analogously to pthread_cancel + pthread_join (for joinable
 * threads). The default destructor sends a single-frame message
 * from the string "$TERM". zactor_set_destructor, which can set
 * a custom destructor is a DRAFT method only available in latest
 * commits, so we stick to the default one for now. But since we
 * want to deal with integer signals, and not string messages, we
 * define s_task_stop as a wrapper around zactor_destroy, which
 * sends SIG_STOP and then calls zactor_destroy to wait for the
 * handler to return.
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------
 ------------------------------- TO DO -----------------------------
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------
 * - Test with using more than one of the rings: how to get the NIC
 *   to fill the rest.
 * - Set CPU affinity for each task.
 * - Save-to-file:
 *   -- FIX: check if all filenames (-measurement.*) are valid (i.e.
 *      if symlink, point inside ROOT).
 *   -- Set umask.
 *   -- Check filename for non-printable and non-ASCII characters.
 *   -- Return a string error in case of a failed request or job?
 *   -- FIX: why does the task count more missed packets than
 *      coordinator?
 *   -- Log REQ jobs in a global database such that it can be looked
 *      up by filename, client IP or time frame.
 *   -- Save the statistics as attributes in the hdf5 file.
 *   -- Generate a filename is none is given.
 * - For REQ/REP sockets: check what happens if client drops out
 *   before reply is sent (will the socket block)?
 * - Why does writing to file fail with "unhandled syscall" when
 *   running under valgrind? A:
 *   https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=219715
 * - Print debugging stats every UPDATE_INTERVAL via the
 *   coordinator.
