Layout of the trunk is:
- include:      header files
- src/bin:      source binary files
- src/bin/test: miscellaneous test files
- src/lib:      source library files
- lib:          compiled libraries (created by make install if missing)
- bin:          compiled binaries  (created by make install if missing)

There is a Makefile in both src/bin and src/lib which is used respectively to
build and install binaries or libraries. From the trunk do:

 cd src/lib
 make all
 make install
 cd ../bin
 make all
 make install

There is also a Makefile in src/bin/test used to compile the test binaries.
There is no install target for it. Simply do:
 
 cd src/bin/test
 make <name_of_executable_without_extension>

or

 make all

The Makefiles in src/bin and src/bin/test will link with the necessary
libraries (and it will make sure include and lib in the trunk are given to
gcc). Before running a program in bin/ do:

 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/trunk/lib

To modify CFLAGS and other global parameters passed to gcc (or the compiler
executable itself), see Makefile in the trunk directory, which is sourced by
the other Makefiles.

bin/server is the server program, bin/client is the client which includes
a help (usage) message when run with no args.

See comments at the beginning of src/lib/fpgatasks.c for the API used in the
client progarm.

Only tested on Linux >4.8.4 and FreeBSD 11.0
