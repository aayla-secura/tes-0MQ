**A UNIX daemon for reading and saving data from the transition edge sensor
(TES) signal processor.**

The daemon is tested on Linux 4.13.0 and FreeBSD 11.0, and above. It requires
[netmap](https://github.com/luigirizzo/netmap) patched drivers for the NIC
connected to the FPGA.

# API

The server accepts client requests on two [ØMQ](http://zeromq.org/) sockets. 

## SERVER INFO REP INTERFACE

This interface accepts requests to reply with and log statistics, such
as bandwidth, missed packets etc.

Valid requests have a picture of "4", replies have a picture of "1888888".

#### Message frames in a valid request

1. **Number of seconds**

   How many seconds to accumulate stats for. It must be non-zero.

   The value is read as an **unsigned** int32.

#### Message frames in a reply

1. **Error status**

 * "0": OK, sending trace

 * "1": invalid request

2. **No. of processed packets**

3. **No. of missed packets**

4. **No. of invalid packets**

5. **No. of ticks**

6. **No. of MCA packets**

7. **No. of trace packets**

## CAPTURE REP INTERFACE

This interface accepts requests to save all received frames, until a given
minimum number of tick frames and a given minimum number of events are seen, to
a file (on the server). It can also return the status of a previous successful
request.

Messages are sent and read via `zsock_send` and `zsock_recv` respectively.
These are simply multi-frame ØMQ messages, with each frame being a string
representation of the value.

Valid requests have a picture of "ss88111", replies have a picture of "18888888".

At the moment we only handle one request at a time. Will block until done.

#### Message frames in a valid request

1. **Filename**

   Basename for the hdf5 file (no extension). It is relative to a hardcoded
   root, leading slashes are ignored. Trailing slashes are not allowed. Missing
   directories are created.

2. **Measurement**

   Name of hdf5 group relative to a hardcoded topmost group. It must be non-empty
   if conversion is to be done (now or at a later request).
   
3. **No. of ticks**

   The server will record all packets (including ethernet header) until at
   least that many ticks are seen.

   The value is read as an **unsigned** int64.

4. **No. of events**

   The server will record all packets (including ethernet header) until at
   least that many non-tick events are seen.

   The value is read as an **unsigned** int64.

5. **Write mode**

 * "0": do not overwrite hdf5 file or measurement group

 * "1": only rename existing measurement group

 * "2": overwrite entire hdf5 file

6. **Asyncronous conversion**

 * "0": reply when hdf5 file is finalized

 * "1": reply when hdf5 conversion begins

7. **Capture mode**

 * "0": auto: capture and convert unless only status is requested

 * "1": capture only: at least one of ticks or events must be given

 * "2": convert only: neither ticks nor events can be given

If neither ticks nor events is given **and** capture mode is auto, the
request is interpreted as a status request and the reply that was sent
previously for this filename is re-sent.

A job will only terminate at receiving a tick, and only if both the minimum
number of ticks and the minimum number of non-tick events has been recorded.

As a consequence of how `zsock_recv` parses arguments, the client may omit
frames corresponding to ignored arguments or arguments which are "0".
Therefore to get a status of a file, only the filename and possibly
measurement is required.

#### Message frames in a reply

Some return codes, namely 1, 4 and 7 may indicate an error in either
capture or conversion. This should be obvious from the time it took to
receive the reply.

1. **Error status**

 * "0": writing finished successfully (in case of write request) or
        status of a valid previous job was read (in case of status request)

 * "1": capture request was not understood or
        conversion request was not understood (capture was successful)
 
 * "2": file exists (in case of a no-overwrite request) or
        file does not exist (in case of status request)

 * "3": filename did not resolve to an allowed path

 * "4": error initializing capture, nothing was written or
        error initializing conversion (capture was successful)

 * "5": error while writing to files, some data was saved

 * "6": error while converting to hdf5 format

 * "7": error while writing stats (capture ok, conversion aborted) or
        error deleting data files (conversion was successful)

2. **No. of ticks written**

   May be less than requested in case of an error during write. *Error status*
   will be "5" in this case.


3. **No. of non-tick events written**


4. **No. of traces written**


5. **No. of histograms written**


6. **No. of frames written**


7. **No. of frames dropped by NIC**


8. **No. of frames dropped by us (invalid)**

## AVERAGE TRACE REP INTERFACE

This interface accepts requests to get the first average trace within
a given time period.

Valid requests have a picture of "4", replies have a picture of "1b".

#### Message frames in a valid request

1. **Timeout**

   Number of seconds to wait for an average trace.

   The value is read as an **unsigned** int32.

#### Message frames in a reply

1. **Error status**

 * "0": OK, sending trace

 * "1": invalid request

 * "2": timeout error

 * "3": trace was corrupt

2. **Trace data**

   Empty in case of timeout error. Otherwise---the full trace.

## MCA HISTOGRAM PUB INTERFACE

This interface publishes ZMQ single-frame messages, each message
contains one full histogram (MCA stream). You can receive these with
`zmq_recv` for example.

## JITTER HISTOGRAM REP+PUB INTERFACE

This interface publishes ZMQ single-frame messages, each message
contains one full histogram, representing the jitter between two
channels and constructed over a configurable number of ticks. The
histogram has a fixed number of bins, each of width 1. The reference
channel is also configurable. Each point in the histogram corresponds to
a frame of the non-reference channel. If it falls in the positive bin
range, it gives the delay (in units of 4ns) since the last reference
channel frame. If it falls in the negative bin range, it gives the delay
(in units of 4ns) until the next reference channel frame. There is only
one entry for each non-reference frame: the smallest absolute value of
the two possibilities being taken. (i.e. if the delay since the last
reference is smaller than the delay before the next reference, the
positive entry is taken, and vice versa).

You can receive these histograms with `zmq_recv` for example.

Reference channel and number of ticks to accumulate over is configured
by sending a message to the REP socket. Valid requests have a picture of
"18", replies have a picture of "1".

#### Message frames in a valid request

1. **Reference channel**

   The value is read as an **unsigned** int8.

1. **Ticks**

   The value is read as an **unsigned** int64.

#### Message frames in a reply

1. **Error status**

 * "0": OK, sending trace

 * "1": invalid request

# INSTALLATION

To compile and install the client (`tesc`) and server (`tesd`):

```
make
make install
make clean
```

The default install prefix is `/usr/local`, to change it:

```
make PREFIX=<path> install
```

Note: it is a GNU makefile, so on some systems (e.g. FreeBSD) you need to use
`gmake`.

Both client and server will print usage when given the '-h' option.

#### TEST APPLICATIONS

To compile the test apps do `make test` or alternatively `make all` to compile
everything. Test apps are not installed in the `PREFIX` location.

# TO DO

* Write REQ job statistics to a global database such that it can be looked up
  by filename, client IP or time frame.
* Web UI
