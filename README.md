**A UNIX daemon for reading and saving data from the transition edge sensor
(TES) signal processor.**

The daemon is tested on Linux 4.13.0 and FreeBSD 11.0, and above. It requires
[netmap](https://github.com/luigirizzo/netmap) patched drivers for the NIC
connected to the FPGA.

# API
---

The server accepts client requests on two [ØMQ](http://zeromq.org/) sockets. 

## REP INTERFACE

This interface accepts requests to save all received frames, until a given
minimum number of tick frames and a given minimum number of events are seen, to
a file (on the server). It can also return the status of a previous successful
request.

Messages are sent and read via `zsock_send` and `zsock_recv` respectively.
These are simply multi-frame ØMQ messages, with each frame being a string
representation of the value.

Valid requests have a picture of "s881", replies have a picture of "1888888",
as explained below.

At the moment we only handle one request at a time. Will block until done.

#### Message frames in a valid request

1. **Filename**

   It is relative to a hardcoded root, leading slashes are ignored.
   Trailing slashes are not allowed. Missing directories are created.
   
2. **No. of ticks**

   The server will record all packets (including ethernet header) until at
   least that many ticks are seen.

   The value is read as an **unsigned** int64.

   Alternatively, if it is 0, the request is interpreted as a status request
   and the reply that was sent previously for this filename is re-sent.

2. **No. of events**

   The server will record all packets (including ethernet header) until at
   least that many non-tick events are seen.

   The value is read as an **unsigned** int64.

3. **Write mode**

 * "0": create but do not overwrite

 * "1": create or overwrite

A job will only terminate at receiving a tick, and only if both the minimum
number of ticks and the minimum number of non-tick events has been recorded.

As a consequence of how `zsock_recv` parses arguments, the client may omit
frames corresponding to ignored arguments or arguments which are "0". Therefore
to get a status of a file, only the filename is required.

#### Message frames in a reply

1. **Error status**

 * "0": writing finished successfully (in case of write request) or
        status of a valid previous job was read (in case of status request)

 * "1": request was malformed
 
 * "2": file exists (in case of a no-overwrite request) or
        file does not exist (in case of status request)

 * "3": filename did not resolve to an allowed path

 * "4": error while opening the file, nothing was written

 * "5": error while writing to file, some data was saved

2. **No. of ticks written**

   May be less than requested in case of an error during write. *Error status*
   will be "5" in this case.


3. **No. of non-tick events written**


4. **No. of traces written**


5. **No. of histograms written**


6. **No. of frames written**


7. **No. of frames dropped by NIC**

## PUB INTERFACE

This socket publishes ZMQ single-frame messages, each message contains one full
histogram (MCA stream). You can receive these with `zmq_recv` for example.

# INSTALLATION
---

To compile and install the client (`tesc`) and server (`tesd`):

```
make
make install
make clean
```

The default install prefix is `/usr/local`, to change it:

```
make PREFIX=<path> install
```

Note: it is a GNU makefile, so on some systems (e.g. FreeBSD) you need to use
`gmake`.

Both client and server will print usage when given the '-h' option.

#### TEST APPLICATIONS

To compile the test apps do `make test` or alternatively `make all` to compile
everything. Test apps are not installed in the `PREFIX` location.

# TO DO
---

* Write REQ job statistics to a global database such that it can be looked up
  by filename, client IP or time frame.
* Web UI
